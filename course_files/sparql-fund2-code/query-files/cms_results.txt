Established in honor of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the site plan is to have at least 80,000 articles by 5 December 2007, the king's 80 birthday. There is some English content, mostly providing information about the Royal Projects. The articles come from two different sources: Current articles written by experts. New articles to be written by volunteers. All the content will be copyrighted, unlike the other Web-based encyclopedias. The project claims itself as a wiki and states that users can make changes to the articles but there is no such functionality since its launch. The website allows creation of articles and adding comments to the already-created articles. However, the registration is required.

The API is implemented as an XML-RPC web service with three methods whose names describe their function: metaweblog. newPost, metaweblog. getPost and metaweblog. editPost. These methods take arguments that specify the blog author's username and password along with information related to an individual weblog entry. The impetus for the creation of the API in 2002 was perceived limitations of the Blogger API, which serves the same purpose.

Robbins was an employee of O'Reilly And Associates in the early 1990s and participated in the development of Global Network Navigator, the first commercial web publication, before founding the web design company Liquid Media in 1994. Also in 1994, Robbins and drummer Paul Buckley founded Orbit, a Boston-based power trio that released four CDs. Robbins left the technology industry when the band was signed to A&amp;M Records records to focus on touring and recording. In 2001, he married writer Jennifer Niederst, author of O'Reilly and Associates' Web Design in a Nutshell. After A&amp;M Records was absorbed by Universal Music Group, Orbit was dropped and Robbins returned to web development. In 2004, Robbins began working with Drupal, designing sites for several high-profile artists including Ringo Starr, and became an active participant in the project's developer community. In January 2006, he and developer Matt Westgate co-founded Lullabot, a Drupal-focused consultancy.

The company provides Internet applications and communications strategies to Democratic Party organizations, political candidates, and non-profit organizations. The BuyBlue. org project has been run by Advomatic since June 14, 2007. Advomatic has since put the project on hiatus. Founder Aaron Welch was on leave from Advomatic between July 2007 and November 2007 to work on the presidential campaign of Senator Chris Dodd. Advomatic builds websites using the free and open source content management system Drupal. In July 2008, BlueAmerica PAC hired Advomatic to build a calling tool that lets voters call their senators ask them what their stance is on the spy legislation, and to urge them to vote for an amendment that would remove the telecom immunity provision."@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

As implied by its previous names, it was used to power websites supporting the 2004 presidential campaign of Howard Dean. The distribution of the open source content management system based on Drupal focused on political websites. It includes added functionality used for political and other organizing. The innovations in the CivicSpace distribution of Drupal have been incorporated into Drupal 5.0. CivicSpace began the process of unforking from the Drupal project in March 2005. On July 1 2005, CivicSpace released a fully compatible distribution of Drupal. CivicSpace founders and employees are actively involved in the Drupal project. Zack Rosen and Kieran Lal are Drupal association board members. Neil Drumm is currently the Drupal 5 maintainer. CivicSpace hired almost 40 hobby developers from the Drupal community over the last three years, providing many with key steps to becoming fully employed to work with Drupal. CivicSpace was focused on a managed version of CivicSpace to expand beyond the technical users who were the early adopters of the platform. The hosted version was available as a free and low monthly cost subscription service for 22 months. CivicSpace Labs stopped offering its free hosting service as of July 1st, 2008. The source code for the hosted provisioning of Drupal and CiviCRM is being made available. Please note: The CivicSpace software has been incorporated into Drupal 5 and CiviCRM and cannot be downloaded from civicspacelabs. org.

| <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pinax_%28software%29>                  | dbpedia2:abstract            | "Pinax is an open source platform for rapidly developing websites, based on the Django web application framework, written in Python. It came out of an effort to further the use of reusable apps, to make a more accessible bundle of the many components already available for Django, and enabling rapid development of different kinds of web sites. During its initial development, Pinax was used to create a social networking web site, later spun off as Cloud27. Pinax is highly regarded in the Django community, and could be seen as a competitor to large, open source, content management frameworks as Drupal and Plone. Pinax was initially announced with the name Tabula Rasa, but it was changed to Pinax a few days later."@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

It can be used on any web server that has PHP and MySQL installed. It is available as free software under the GNU General Public License. Ubercart is fully integrated with Drupal, meaning you can fully integrate your store with the rest of your web site or community. It can be used to sell shippable goods, downloadable products, recurring memberships, event tickets, and enable complex interactions with Drupal through various add-on contributions, such as multi-seller stores, discount coupons, affiliate programs, software license codes, or customizable goods. As with Drupal, it can be set up to run in multiple languages, or to use an alternate currency. Numerous payment gateways and shipping options are available. The current stable release of Ubercart is based on version 5 of Drupal, with a beta version available for Drupal 6. Development of Ubercart began in 2006 and reached its 1.0 release on 4 June, 2008."@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

Starfrosch organised the first European Netlabel meeting in Bern, which took place on 17 February 2005, and operates the very first Podcast in Switzerland."@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

News stories usually consist of a summary of a recent discussion from a development mailing list followed by the entire contents of several messages from the discussion. Each story has moderated threaded discussion attached to it. The site also includes a forum for general discussion of computing topics. The site uses the Drupal content management system. Kerneltrap has been hosted by the Oregon State University Open Source Lab since May 2005. The site is operated by Jeremy Andrews.

The site publishes news and opinion on the medium of comics with a focus on digital publication such as webcomics. It features an online magazine published on a monthly basis as well as a daily blog and discussion forum. Interviews with key creators such as James Kochalka and Matt Madden have also been a feature. ComixTalk was founded under the name Comixpedia, which it held until 2007. The name change was made to differentiate the site from Comixpedia. org, a webcomic-based wiki site that was hosted by ComixTalk until mid-2007 (Comixpedia. org is now operated by Josh Roberts of ComicSpace). The website runs on the Drupal content management system and has since 2006.

The Odiogo generated content can be listened to on Windows/Mac PCs, Mobile phones and iPods/MP3 players. Odiogo's proprietary algorithms perform several pre and post processing tasks on the content before it is processed by state of the art Text to speech engines. Odiogo users can deploy the Listen Button widget on their content site. Located near the familiar \"Email\" and \"Print\" buttons on top of each article in mainstream media and blogs, the Listen Button when clicked will open a player which will read aloud the currently displayed article.

| dbpedia:Zenith_Content_Management_System                            | dbpedia2:abstract            | "The Zenith Content Management System was originally developed by Bruce Davis Associates. Early versions were developed using Microsoft Access as a database with an ASP wrapper to provide the interface. However, this proved to be unsatisfactory, and the system was quickly re-written using the de facto standard of PHP and MySQL as a database. The latest version in this form was 3.22. Following the demise of the web development arm of Bruce Davis Associates in early 2008, Network Ltd adopted support for the system. Due to the architecture of the system it was deemed unsuitable for future development, and is currently only in an extended support phase. Zenith 4.0 is currently being developed. Instead of being a stand-alone system, it is a plug-in module for Drupal. Inkeeping with Drupal methodology it will be released as Open Source software in due course."@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The Oil Drum is facilitated by the Institute for the Study of Energy and Our Future, a Colorado non-profit corporation. The site is a resource for information on many energy and sustainability topics, including peak oil, and related concepts such as oil megaprojects, Hubbert Linearization, and the Export Land Model. The Oil Drum has over 25 online contributors from all around the globe. The Oil Drum was rated one of the top five sustainability blogs of 2007 by Nielsen Netratings, and is read by a diverse collection of public figures, including Roscoe Bartlett, Paul Krugman, James Howard Kunstler, Richard Rainwater, Matthew Simmons, and Radiohead. In 2008, the site received the M. King Hubbert Award for Excellence in Energy Education from the U.S. chapter of the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas (ASPO). The Oil Drum was started in March 2005 by Kyle Saunders (username \"Prof. Goose\"), a professor of political science at Colorado State University, and Dave Summers (username \"Heading Out\"), a professor of mining engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology (then known as University of Missouri-Rolla). The site first rose to prominence following its coverage of the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on oil and gas production. Since then, the staff has grown by dozens and the site has become well-known for rigorous, quantitative analysis of energy production and consumption. Notable examples include editor Stuart Staniford's analysis of the depletion of Saudi Arabia's Ghawar oil field and Saunders's analysis of Chinese cement production and consumption. The site has steadily increased its global reach by adding localized sites for Europe, Canada, and Australia/New Zealand, as well as a site about local activism. The site started out on the Blogger platform, moved to Scoop in August 2005, and to Drupal in December 2006."@en                                 |

Appliances are packaged as a single universal image capable of supporting installations on both physical and virtual machines, including VMware, Xen, VirtualBox, and KVM. Installation of an appliance to a virtual machine creates a virtual appliance.

This enables authors to keep track of who is linking, and so referring, to their articles. Some weblog software programs, such as Serendipity, Wordpress, CuteNewsRU, Movable Type, Typo, Telligent Community, Kentico CMS and Drupal (via contrib modules), support automatic pingbacks where all the links in a published article can be pinged when the article is published. The term is used colloquially for any kind of linkback."@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

It was launched in 2004 as a public beta, and in 2007 launched at the South By Southwest Interactive festival on the Drupal platform. The site serves as a repository for all of the footage for Basement Tapes, licensed under a Creative Commons license, which the audience is free to remix. The site also hosts user-generated remixes that have subsequently been edited into the final film. The website was created by Montreal filmmaker Brett Gaylor. He was member of the panel of experts during South by Southwest venue in 2007. Gaylor's Basement Tapes project and feedbacks blossomed into a documentary that was renamed prior to theatrical release to become RiP!: A Remix Manifesto, an \"open source\" documentary about copyright and remix culture. Created over a period of six years, the film features the collaborative remix work of hundreds of people who have contributed to the Open Source Cinema website, helping to create, according to Gaylor, the \"world's first open source documentary\"."@en                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
